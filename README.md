Slearch
=======

This extension add's a keyboard shortcut to Chrome. When pressing the `/` key Slearch will find the first search field it can on the page and focus it.

### Installing

This project has no dependencies so installation is simple, clone the project to a folder on your computer, tick `developer mode` and then follow the `load unpacked extension` process.

### Known Issues

It does not work on all pages, this might be because the matching criteria fails to find it or because the search bar is hidden behind a JavaScript method which does not trigger when the search bar is focused. Plus others in the [issues](https://github.com/tim545/slearch-chromeBrowserExtension/issues) section.
